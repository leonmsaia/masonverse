This distribution contains a simplified and pre-configured 
version of OpenSim targeting Hypergrided standalone virtual 
worlds. It contains:

1) a subset of the cannonical OpenSim distribution. For the complete
   distribution, please see
   http://opensimulator.org/wiki/Download

2) binaries only

3) additional modules and tools that use external services
   (such as search) and that make configuration and updates
   as easy as possible. 

4) several additional addons, such as a Web application for user
   registrations

5) preconfiguration for use of MySQL DB backend, ODE 
   physics, and a default world consisting of multiple regions

6) additional content in the Library

Please read LICENSE.txt before using this distribution of OpenSim.


******************************************
*** To install, please see INSTALL.txt ***
******************************************


 To run OpenSim you need: 
  - a computer running Linux or Windows with a good-size
    memory (>1G). 

 To access other worlds in the Hypergrid you need:
  - an externally visible IP address or domain name (preferred). 
    If you don't know how to set up an externally 
    visible IP address, this might help you:
    http://portforward.com/
    You need to setup port forwarding on your router, so that all
    traffic to ports 9000 through 9010, TCP and UDP, is forwarded
    to the machine where your OpenSim runs.

------------------------------------------

This is an independent distribution configured in a special
way. Upgrades to this distribution should be done with the Updgrade
tool that is included. Manual upgrades from the cannonical OpenSim
distribution, or any others, will likely break.
